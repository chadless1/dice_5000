#### Rules 
First to score 5000 points wins!

Every roll must contain either a 1 or a 5 or else you score no points.
3 of a kind scores higher.
Keep rolling until you miss or collect your points.
If all dice equal either 1 or 5 you get a "fresh roll" and continue with a fresh set of dice but keep your score.

Points:
- 5 = 50 poits
- 1 = 100 points
- 5(x3) = 500
- 1(x3) = 1000
